I am a data scientist in the Seattle area. I make games in Unity (including VR and AR content) and have a background in physics. I have taught high school and college physics and am currently working on reinforcement learning in games. I'm interested in all things data science and have a big interest in artificial general intelligence. Let's collaborate!
