I am a data scientist in the Seattle area, currently working at Indigo in the healthcare / insurance space. I've been in data analytics since 2017 in Seattle and a Data Scientist since 2020. My academic background is in physics (BSc from Humboldt State University, MSc from Washington State University). Aside from data work, I have made games in Unity (including VR and AR content), 3D model and 3D print interesting and functional things, and taught high school and college physics / chemistry. I'm interested in all things data, 3D modeling / printing, and gaming.
