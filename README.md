I am a data scientist in the Seattle area, currently working at Unity. I have made games in Unity (including VR and AR content) and have an academic background in physics. I have taught high school and college physics / chemistry in the past. I'm interested in all things data science and have a big interest in artificial general intelligence. Let's collaborate!

ðŸ”­ Recent projects:
 * The AI art space
 This is a fast moving area of AI and there are a lot of potential problems with how training data is used and how artists feel about generative AI. A few years ago I was using the Big Sleep codebase which was slow and not very diverse. Things got better with VQGAN models. Current diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion have opened up a lot more flexibility in how useful generative AI can be. I'm removing the old images I had posted since at this point, everyone has seen generative AI art!

 * A twitter bot that tweets bigfoot sightings using a GPT-2 model trained on web scraped sighting data from bfro.net. This twitter bot is dead. RIP sasBOTch!

Example of a generated bigfoot sighting tweeted by sasBOTch:

  <p>Generated sightings will be split and continued as responses to the original tweet if longer than the character limit on twitter.</p>

 * A twitter bot called plotbot that tweets movie plots using GPT-2. Trained on several movie datasets that have titles and plots, including 85,000 movie plots from imdb. Titles and plots were generated and tweeted several times daily. Just like sasBOTch, plotbot is no longer with us. RIP little buddy.
