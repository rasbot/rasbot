I am a data scientist in the Seattle area, currently working at Unity. I make games in Unity (including VR and AR content) and have a background in physics. I have taught high school and college physics in the past. I'm interested in all things data science and have a big interest in artificial general intelligence. Let's collaborate!

ðŸ”­ Recent projects:
 * The AI art space
 This is a fast moving area of AI and there are a lot of potential problems with how training data is used and how artists feel about generative AI. A few years ago I was using the Big Sleep codebase which was slow and not very diverse. Things got better with VQGAN models. Current diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion have opened up a lot more flexibility in how useful generative AI can be. I'm removing the old images I had posted since at this point, everyone has seen generative AI art!

 * A twitter bot that tweets bigfoot sightings using a GPT-2 model trained on web scraped sighting data from bfro.net www.twitter.com/sasBOTch. This twitter bot is dead. RIP sasBOTch!

Examples of tweets sent out:

  <p>Generated sightings will be split and continued as responses to the original tweet if longer than the character limit on twitter.</p>

  <p>Sightings are more or less determinsitic, depending on the hyperparameter tuning during sample generation.</p>

 * A twitter bot that tweets movie plots using a GPT-2 model trained on 85,000 movie plots from imdb. www.twitter.com/plot_bot_. PlotBot is also dead. RIP little buddy.
